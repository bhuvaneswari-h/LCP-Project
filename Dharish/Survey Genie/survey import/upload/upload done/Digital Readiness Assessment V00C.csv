25,36,"Leadership (Thinking of senior leadership in your company, which of the following statements best describes their behaviour when it comes to digital transformation in the company?)",1,There is very little reference to any digital intent at your company leadership level.,1,"Your leaders occasionally talk to a digital intent, but it is not incorporated in the company strategy, nor are there any significant initiatives underway.",2,"Your leaders have clearly articulated a digital services and or transformation intent. Execution details, leadership, and incentivisation are unclear.",3,"A quorate of individuals in your company are taking initial steps to embed digital services and ways of working. Whilst they have leadership blessing, their initiatives are ad-hoc and meeting some resistance.",4,Your company has an official company-wide initiative aimed at embedding digital services and ways of working. Your leadership are vocal about its importance and have incentivised key resources on its success. Early benefits have been seen from quick-wins although it is taking some time to get traction on wholesale operating model changes.,5,Your leadership have declared to the market their intent to digitally transform the organisation's services and ways of working. The initiative is potentially share-price impacting. Significant resources are being invest to a central team that has the mandate to make significant changes across all organisational departments.,6
25,36,Risk appetite,1,Your company is very risk-adverse to anything that could upset current financial projections or ways of working.,1,"Your company is predominantly focused on the next financial quarter/year. Your leadership may occasionally reference digital intent, but there is little evidence of significant investment.",2,"Your leadership have communicated a high-level digital intent and kicked off a number of pilots. Pilot failure is not received well, however, and a number of pilots are closed down when finances get tight at the end of a financial quarter/year.",3,Your company has a high-level digital intent and there may even be broad/small incentives to deliver against it. There are a significant number of initiatives afoot across the organisation although they lack co-ordination.,4,"You have a comprehensive, publicly communicated, multi-year digital programme in place. It has attracted sufficient ring-fenced investment/focus to be moderately share-price impacting. Wholesale change to your organisation is sanctioned and it is accepted that this may result in a dip in performance and that some ideas will fail.",5,"Your digital intent is at the heart of the company's future direction, as communicated to share-holders. All business unit leads are heavily incentivised on change and recognise that some short-term financial pain may be required. Delivery of objectives could have substantial impact on share-price.",6
25,36,Eco-system,1,"Your company has no true partnerships nor intent to innovate with outside parties. Information channels with suppliers and customers are formal, with little chance of feedback their leading to meaningful change.",1,"Your leaderships may talk superficially about listening to the customer and collaborating with partners, but it is extremely clear that day to day focus should be on achieving internal targets. You guard your IP and business information extremely tightly. You never seek out external experts, nor do you ever invest in start-ups or external research.",2,"Some of your leaders are actively looking to improve external collaboration e.g. through NPS or supplier forums, but very little concrete action comes from the intent. Your external relationships are predominantly transactional. You rarely seek out external experts, or invest in start-ups or external research.",3,"There is a general understanding across the organisation that more needs to be done to understand customers and collaborate on ideas.  There are many dis-jointed efforts underway. This is often confusing to external parties. Funding and a mandate for these initiatives is often lacking, resulting in many petering out. ",4,"You have a company-wide initiative aimed at improving eco-system engagement. It has a clear mandate and significant funding. Many individuals are incentivised on the its success. You are pro-actively seeking out external experts, start-ups and research. Caution remains in terms of the information that can be shared with partners and how much time can be spent on partner-raised initiatives. It is ea",5,"Improving customer and partner engagement is at the centre of company action, and company-wide incentivisation underpins it. The company is  open in terms of sharing information and could not survive without key partners. Significant time is spent in cross-company teams. You spend significant effort engaging external experts, start-ups, and research, and have recently made a number of start-up acqu",6
25,36,Collaboration,1,Your company has rigid business units and roles that deal transactionally with each other. Your processes are highly linear and include a lot of hand-offs between business units. Very little time is spent with people outside of your home department.,1,"Your leadership talk superficially about improving collaboration. Occasional steering or working groups may be established to encourage collaborative decision-making, but little day-to-day work is delivered with people outside of your home department. It is recognised that process hand-offs cause significant inefficiency.",2,"Your leadership recognise that silo'd working is leading to a lot of inefficiencies. A number of cross-unit working teams have been established and some process changes embedded to encourage collaboration rather than hand-offs. Incentivisation and leadership focus, however, is still very much fixed on the success of home business units.",3,"Key business units are beginning to collaborate more together and share some incentives. Process changes are encouraging multi-unit collaboration and working groups seem to be cropping up everywhere. There is wide-spread recognition, however, that this collaboration is ad-hoc and un-coordinated.",4,There is a serious company-wide intent to collaborate across business unit boundaries. You have a clear operating model that encourages this in a co-ordinated manner. A significant % of people's time is spent with workers from other departments. A significant proportion of incentives are reliant on the success of other departments.,5,The concept of a business unit is fluid in your organisation. A high proportion of time is spent in cross-BU teams. Incentivisation is often task- rather than role-orientated and shared by cross-BU working teams. Your workplace is designed to suit flexible teams.,6
25,36,Agility,1,"You company takes a strictly waterfall approach to product development and you are not aware of any recent attempts to improve processes. Jobs are measured on outputs, as defined by JDs or processes. There are a lot of hand-offs. Your developers reside in a 'black-box' and are rarely engage with anyone else.",1,"Your leadership talk superficially about moving to more agile ways of working. There may be an occasional pilot to trial iterative product development or process improvement but it is not a common approach. Jobs are measured on outputs, as defined by JDs or processes.",2,Your leadership recognise that greater agility is required. Some members of your product and IT teams have been trained up in agile methods although they are generally unable to utilise the approach in practice. A few basic process improvements have been made with the objective to increase speed.,3,"Some key individuals in your organisation are leading a crusade towards agile working. As such, some iterative, outcome-focussed, test-driven characteristics are starting to creep into your product development and process improvement approach. Progress is ad-hoc, however, and most people are still focussed and measured on outputs.",4,"There is a serious company-wide intent to establish more agile working. A robust approach and sophisticated tooling has been invested in and is progressively driving iterative, out-come focused, test-driven behaviours. There remains some resistance from 'old-timers', but the majority see the benefits.",5,"Your company has a highly-iterative and service-orientated approach to product development and service improvement, backed up by a robust approach and sophisticated tooling. Your developers spend a significant amount of time engaging with users, often face-to-face. Your working teams are typically multi-departmental or multi-organisational, outcome-incentivised, and self-organising. Your developmen",6
25,37,Technology as a multiplier,1,Your IT estate is jumble of legacy systems. Most processes sit across multiple un-connected systems. There is little ability to automatically share useful data.,1,Your CIO may talk about the need for a coherent IT strategy but there is no obvious architecture of investment behind the idea. There are some 'sticking plasters' in place where legacy systems are patched together to support the most key processes. IT are very protective of the IT estate and there are serious concerns as to security risk.,2,"There is leadership recognition that digital capabilities should be a consideration of the business, not just IT. However, the business is generally caught up in the day job and, whilst passes lighly-specced requirements to IT, doesn't invest significant time in achieving the desired output. Some new platforms and APIs have been invested in, but they're not truly transformational.",3,"Some business unit leaders and the CIO recognise the benefits digital transformation can bring and secure a reasonable level of funding to this end. IT estate rationalisation and cost reduction is at the heart of this. New systems bring moderate benefits, typically increasing the quality of time of a transaction by a few %. Vendor selection takes significant time and 'safe' options usually selected",4,"Most business unit leaders and the CIO believe digital transformation to be critical to the future. Revenue growth, as well as cost transformation, is at the heart of the business case for change. Some new platforms bring exponential benefits. Some smaller technology providers are incorporated into the IT stack.",5,All leadership are heavily focussed on digital transformation. Customer experience and revenue growth are at the heart of the business case for change. New platforms bring heavy exponential benefits. A substantial eco-system of potential new technology partners is constantly under review. A number of technology start-up investments/acquisitions has been made.,6
25,37,Data and APIs,1,"Your company's data resides in disparate, un-connected tools. Most staff are not aware of what data is available. Staff undertake regular re-entry of data as systems are un-connected. There is significant frustration that available data can't be used to help decision-making in a timely manner. Workflows typically get stuck at the point of system hand-offs",1,"Your CIO has stated an intent to join-up key sources of disparate data and has put some basic 'vendor-recommend' APIs between in place. This integration is inflexible, however, and only members of the IT department are able to make changes. There is significant frustration as to the inability to get the right data at the right time. ",2,"There is high level recognition that data can provide value, but little attempt to quantify it. Your company has a lot of APIs but they are generally developed in an ad-hoc tactical manner with cost reduction in mind, and are predominantly the concern of IT. ",3,"Your company has a basic data strategy and data model with some quantification and a small team focussed on delivering it. Whilst some quick wins have been touted, data compliance/security/budget concerns are restricting progress. There are pockets of API-champions developing highly useful APIs that can bring benefit to the wider-business and partners. They are not well understood, however.",4,"Your company has a well-architected, quantified data strategy and model with requirements from the whole business taken into account. It's benefits are predominantly as a result of cost reduction. You are in the process of transforming your IT estate. Data compliance and security concerns have been allayed. Early wins are proving to be highly beneficial to the business. You have a structured approa",5,"Your company's strategy values data as a key source of differentiation. Benefits are expected from revenue enhancement and monetization of data, as well as cost reduction. You have a central data-lake consisting of both structured and un-structured data, and with significant AI capability. The concept of API-as--a-service is embedded in the culture. People across the business and  external partners",6
25,37,AI/ML/automation,1,Your company has no AI or machine learning (ML) supporting key processes. IT automation of tasks is minimal. Your operations are heavily reliant on the talent of your people.,1,Your company has captured some basic linear workflows into systems which has resulted in moderate improvements in speed and consistency. You remain highly dependent on human operators for even the most basic of processes. Your company has no AI or ML capabilities.,2,Your CIO is investigating how AI/ML/automation might be able to improve business operations and some quantification has been completed.  A little 'process simplification' work has been undertaken by the IT team. Minimal investment has been secured to drive this initiative forward and there has been little engagement with external vendors.,3,"Various departments, including IT, have an active interest in utilising AI/ML and automation technologies. A disparate set of improvement initiatives have been prepared and funded, with some early successes. Some vendors have been engaged.",4,"Your company has agreed an over-arching strategy and business case for AI/ML/automation. It is being executed through a well-structured plan, and a competent cross-business team. An array of vendors have been engaged. There is a plan for most displaced resources to engage in more value-adding tasks.",5,"Automation/AI/ML is at the heart of your company's operating model. 'Autonomous', 'robotic' and 'IOT' technologies are widely dispersed throughout operations. AI is providing insights beyond human-capability. Your ratio of profit to headcount is industry-leading.",6
25,37,Connectivity and IOT,1,"Your IT architecture supports little beyond the most basis transactional interactions. Mobile, social, locational, and real-time capabilities are almost non-existent.",1,"Your IT team is seeking to provide some quick-wins around social media, multi-channel customer engagement, and very basic asset tracking. You may have a very basic data model.",2,"Your leadership recognises that more granular visibility of operations and customer sentiment would be beneficial. Some 'pilot' work has been done on standardisation of data models and connectivity of devices, although there is little visualisation so the data remains abstract. Customer interaction and asset tracking is gradually becoming more sophisticated.",3,"Your IT department is trying to build a simple data model that tracks your core operational processes, and builds greater insight around customer sentiment. This includes some locational, real-time data as well as basic bots. It is not yet widely utilised across the organisation.",4,"Your leadership is invested in utilising a central data repository to improve customer service and operational efficiency. This repository contains granular, near-real-time data relating to physical and virtual assets, collected through a network of bots and  devices. Your improved understanding of customers has seen a rise in metrics. Analytics software provide input to some business decisions. Pr",5,"Your company has a holistic connectivity and device architecture in place with highly granular real-time data. You effectively have a virtual model of your business. Analytical and predictive software is processing many work-flows automatically and providing increased accuracy in terms of future predictions. New business models are in use, where costs are off-set by a guaranteed service. Physical a",6
25,37,Security,1,"Your company has some disparate security controls in place around applications, data, and infrastructure. There is no clear security architecture and changes to the IT estate are resisted. ",1,"Your company has a basic high level security architecture but no risk-based model associated with it. There is some attempt to provide security holistically across applications, data, and infrastructure, and also maintain standards during patches and upgrades. The company is reactive to security compliance requirements. IT is pretty resistant to new technology.",2,"You have a full-time security team in place but they predominantly respond to incidents rather than strategically lower the cyber risk of the ICT estate. The team are nervous about engaging external experts or subjecting their estate to penetration testing. IT are generally resistant to new technology, although they are trying to balance that with a desire to push forward the digital intent.",3,"A number of key individuals in your company are seeking to measure and lower the security risk of your IT estate in a strategic manner. Security staff are solving route problems, rather than just responding to incidents. Impact/quantification of potential breaches is known at a high level. A number of market-leading vendors engaged.",4,Your company has a structured approach to cyber risk quantification and management. Risk levels are discussed at board level. You have a full time CISO. Your cyber defences involve basic AI. You have a well-trained Security Operations Centre (SOCS) in place who are pre-emptive in assessing potential risks. You are continuously assessing vendors for improvements in technology. ,5,Cyber risk is a major item at board level. You have an holistic cyber defence platform with capabilities from multiple vendors and significant AI processing of real-time data. You purchase data feeds from key providers to increase your insight. Your Security Operations Centre is focussed predominantly on pre-emptive problem solving. You are constantly in active conversation with the most innovative,6
25,38,Culture,1,"Your company's people are over-ridingly focused/incentivised on internal, short-term objectives. There is little encouragement to pull ideas from the market, take risks, solve causal problems, develop capability for the mid-term, or break down silos. The company has a hierarchical leadership style with little cascading of accountability and authority. Decision-making is slow and processes tend to b",1,"Some of your leaders recognise that wholesale culture change is required to be competitive, but little actual investment is made. Leaders are too caught up in fire-fighting to invest in the change required.",2,"Your company has a high level digital strategy and there is wide-spread recognition that significant culture change is required if it is to be a success. The desired change has been documented at a high level and some enthusiastic leaders are trying to drive a little change in their respective silos. Too many leaders are lacking a customer-centricity, innovation, and collaboration focus for the des",3,"Your company has developed a detailed plan for culture change and is investing in leadership training to kick-it off. A few ambassadors are seeding change: rewarding innovation and changing metrics to measure customer outcomes, collaboration, and digital successes. The vast majority of the organisation is still caught up in the 'usual way' of doing things, however.",4,"Your leaders are over-ridingly bought into the benefits of culture change. They are collectively building an outside-in, customer obsessed culture, with enterprise wide collaboration and a strong focus on durable innovation. Many interesting, talented, innovative individuals are keen to join the company.",5,"Customer-centricity, innovation, and collaboration are part of the DNA of your company. Individuals are incentivised on mid/long-term objectives as well as short. Experimentation and risk-taking is expected. Teams are fluid and flexible based on business requirements. You have platforms in place to flexibly track iterative work. You have a wide eco-system and regularly invest in start-ups or extern",6
25,38,Work-force planning,1,"Your company has no over-arching capability and capacity plan. There is little understanding of future demand, nor any consideration as to how roles/tasks can be augmented technically or through external assistance. There is little understanding of market supply and constraints.",1,Your company tracks some basic macro-indicators of capacity and undertakes a rough planning exercise on an annual or bi-annual basis.  The work is very spread-sheet heavy and typically based on historic rather than future data. Voluntary redundancies often lead to talent drain rather than the poorer performers moving on. ,2,"Your leadership are making key decisions based on people data. However. It is predominantly internally focussed, historical and capacity rather than capability centric. Spreadsheets are heavily used. The use of these analytics is presented with some hyperbole .",3,"Pockets of planning talent in your organisation are bringing greater sophistication to your work-force planning. e.g. people and business metrics are actively linked; there is some use of capability assessment frameworks; career progression (joiners, movers, departures) is actively managed. There is some investment in work-force planning tools.",4,"Your company's work-force planning is reliable and informs many key business decisions. It utilise sophisticated tools and incorporates analytics and scenario planning. Information is available in real-time/near-to-real-time. It combines people and business data and predicts supply: joiners, departures, movers etc. 'Hot-spots' are regularly identified.",5,"You company has a highly sophisticated work-force management approach and tools in place. It takes into account future anticipated demand, market supply, augmentation through technology and partners, and the building of capability through training and recruitment. Scenario-planning is at the heart of pre-emptive decision making.",6
25,38,Capability development,1,"Your company develops skills in a reactive and ad-hoc manner. There is limited training budget. Recruitment is typically undertaken reactively to fill a deficit in capacity. Contractors are used in a non-consistent manner.  There are rigid career paths with little consideration of people potential or interest. There is little use of behavioural tests nor non-technical training e.g. coaching, team-b",1,"Your leadership claims it desires to increase the digital capability of the organisation, but serious investment is almost always cut when short-term financial targets are looking tight. Training is usually provided in a 'blanket' manner with little customisation/focus on individual needs/ambitions. Little capability development is provided beyond classroom and web-based training. Recruitment is ad",2,"Your leadership have some detail around the macro level of digital capability they are looking for and roughly how to get there. Translation of this intent into personalised action is hindered by insufficient investment, focus on the day-job, a lack of adequate tooling, or inexperience within the HR team.",3,"Your leadership and HR team have a reasonably well-structure development plan to get the organisation to the desired level of digital capability. They are starting to execute on pockets of substantive and lasting investment, both in terms or upskilling and recruitment. Capability frameworks, mentoring, and behavioural testing are starting to be used, but in their infancy.",4,"Your leadership have a clear digital capability development plan, underpinned by quantifiable assessments of as-is and to-be capability. Some basic consideration of aptitude is included. The company has a portfolio of training and coaching options with some freedom for the individual to select preferred paths.  'Early-adopters' to the new opportunities love the approach, but a quorate of the work-f",5,"Your company has a sophisticated capability development approach that works at both an individual and a macro level. You use market-leading tools that use behavioural science best practice. Future predictions of capability are based on aptitude and potential as well as current skills and experience. Personality tests, training customisation, and coaching/mentoring are used widely and effectively. ",6
25,38,Collaboration,1,"Your company operates in silos and puts informational walls up to partners. Cross-team  engagement is typically formal and information passed along linear processes. Email is used wherever possible, with limited real-time engagement. There are few knowledge repositories to maintain a common knowledge base.",1,"Your leadership indicate a desire to increase collaborative working and occasional establish their own cross-functional teams. There is little cross-functional teaming lower down the organisation, however. Channels for information sharing typically traditional in nature.",2,"The concept of cross-functional teaming is pretty common in your company, although performance management metrics are still mainly business unit aligned. Some collaboration with external parties is sought, but there is little openness of information. The company as looked at social/collaboration platforms and knowledge repositories, but they have not been adopted widely or consistently.",3,"A number of cross-functional teams have been in place for a period of time at your company, with reasonable success.  Occasionally these teams contain external partners, although information sharing with remains somewhat limited. There has been investment in social/collaboration platforms and knowledge repositories, and a growing proportion of staff members are using them.",4,"Cross-functional teams contain external parties and are generally self-organising and agile in their approach to meeting outcomes. joining these teams.

A social/collaboration platform  and knowledge repository is commonly used across the organisation, allowing teams to work together on common deliverables in real-",5,Internal and external teams all work together in a fluid manner. There is little restriction to information sharing between business units/companies.  Collaboration/social platforms are used extensively to enable real-time/multi-party work. New innovations are regularly informed by partners and customers. Your company has a strong knowledge management system that is perceived to be a differentiator,6
25,38,Work composition,1,Individuals in your company sit in formal roles with little flexibility in what they do. The company has  poorly defined career paths with little consideration of potential/personal interest. There is little ambition for fixing low value/frustrating parts of jobs.,1,Individual's roles are predominantly rigid within your company although there is some flexibility in approach if outputs are met. There is some clarity around career paths although little sense of meritocracy in terms of promotions. Talented individuals usually suffering task overload with weaker individuals being 'carried'. There is little consideration as to how roles will change in the future.,2,"Your leadership have stated an intent to bring greater 'fluidity' to the working practices. They have established staff feedback mechanism to generate ideas, although little change has come from it. Career progression is ad-hoc and there is little work load balancing around work apportionment with talent over-loaded.",3,"A number of your leaders are driving a sustained focus on automation and continuous improvement, with moderate but growing success. There is wide-spread concern as to technology taking people's jobs. Career progression is structured for talent but ad-hoc for the rest of the organisation. There is some work load balancing around work apportionment but its application is dependent on the quality of t",4,"Structured activity analysis is undertaken and drives continuous improvement, with a reasonable budget for automation. There is flexibility in work-location, albeit a strong focus on building collaborative teams. Individuals are measured more on achieving outcomes, rather than how they achieve them. There is a little flexibility for individuals to pursue 'personal interest' work.",5,Your company puts significant emphasis on the use of cross-functional teams with clear delegated accountabilities and authority. They are measured almost exclusively on their ability to achieve customer-centric outcomes or reduce risk. You have a flat work structure and employees are encouraged to spend a portion of their time on innovative or continuous improvement projects. There is significant i,6
27,40,Insight and testing,1,Your company has nothing but the most rudimentary tools for capturing and utilising customer insight and feedback,1,"Your company has a basic customer feedback mechanism in place e.g. NPS, but little is done with the feedback.",2,"Your company captures, processes, and understands basic customer feedback company-wide. Some action taken on easy service fixes, but there is little activity in terms of root problem fixes or improving new product launches/upgrades.",3,"Your company consistently captures reasonably granular customer feedback on products and services but some preferential filtering is undertaken to give subjective results. Some action is taken in response to incidents but significant root problems are yet to be addressed. New products are tested with customers, but in a qualitative manner rather than through comprehensive or parallel testing.",4,"Customer insight and testing is common company-wide. Reasonably sophisticated tools are used to support the activity and feedback into product design, marketing campaign and service improvement. Service improvement ideas are dealt with via structured programmes and feedback is responded to in a professional and timely manner. Detailed customer insight is sought when designing new products and servi",5,Gathering and responding to customer insight and testing is recognised as one of the most critical activities of your company. Sophisticated tools are in place to help measure representative customer samples. Parallel testing is used extensively. Your company may have a Chief Customer Officer and a customer advisory board may well be in place. Response to customer insight on both in-life and new pr,6
27,40,Segmentation and Personalisation,1,"Your company treats customers homogenously. There is little variance in product, service, or marketing message.",1,"Your company makes some efforts to divide customers into broad segments, as well as a superficial attempt to adjust marketing messages accordingly. There is no underlying difference in product or service.",2,"Your company utilises a logical approach to segmentation, with sentiment/buying habits differentiated. Some reasonably sophisticated attempts are made to adjust marketing messages and even pricing in line with this differentiation. There is little underlying difference in your products or service wraps.",3,"Your company utilises a sophisticated approach to customer segmentation. Sales, marketing messages, service wraps, and pricing are varied to meeting the differing needs of these segments. There is little underlying difference in the core product.",4,"Your company is organised to service specific customer segments in a customer-centric manner. Sales and marketing teams collaborated closely with product and service to enable significant differences in go-to-market messaging, service wraps, pricing, and product 'shells'.",5,"Your company prides itself in providing a customised service to a granular set of market segments (taking into account both demographics and psychographics). Sales, marketing, product, and service individuals work together in collaborative teams to design and test new products against customer needs. Customer-centricity typically trumps product standardisation.",6
27,40,Metrics and ownership,1,Few individuals outside of your service teams are truly incentivised on customer metrics. Customer metrics have no granularity and are not captured/measured in a scientific or consistent manner. Customer service always plays second fiddle to profit. Your company is considered to provide questionable service and you have a high turn-over of staff working on the 'front-line' with customers.,1,"Your company has basic, high-level customer feedback mechanisms in place e.g. NPS and they are reviewed by leadership. Results are typically skewed by preferential sampling. Few individuals outside of service roles are incentivised on customer metrics.  Staff on the front-line feel un-empowered when customer complaints are raised.",2,A basic customer service metric is included in score-cards across a reasonably broad section of your organisation although the weighting is small. Focus on short-term profit-chasing typically trumps that on long-term customer loyalty. Staff on the front-line feel un-empowered when customer complaints fall outside basic processes.,3,"A number of customer service metrics are captured in a competent tool, and give meaningful feedback to your product development, sales, and service teams. The majority of the organisation are incentivised on at least one of these metrics. Accountability for bespoke investments to allay customer concerns or build customer sentiment resides pretty high in the organisation.",4,Your company has a sophisticated tool for capturing  a granular set of customer metrics and test results. These metrics have a significant enough weighting on score-cards to ensure staff predominantly take a customer-centric approach. A set of delegated authorities enable staff on the front line to take accountability and fix pertinent issues.,5,Everyone in your organisation is incentivised on a granular set of customer-centric metrics in a synched manner. This establishment of customer value is taken into account rather than just anecdotal feedback. Long-term customer loyalty metrics are included. Delegated authorities enable even the most junior staff to be agile int the fixing of customer issues.,6
27,40,Customer journeys,1,"Your company's products and processes are designed to suit your staff and the management of your assets, with little thought to customer requirements. Your organisation as a number of silos. Service problems typically raised by customers rather than your own staff.",1,"You company has made some high level attempts to improve ordering, fulfilment and problem resolving processes such that they better serve customers. Hand-offs between departments remains a significant issue however. There has been no attempt to consider the customer journey end-to-end.",2,"A cross-functional team has looked at improving ordering, fulfilment and problem-resolving processes, and some effort has been made to improve hand-offs. Changes made have been as a result on internal staff's perception of improvement opportunities rather than in close engagement with actual customers.",3,"Basic customer journeys have been designed and hot-spots identified. This has included some limited engagement of customers.  Increased inter-departmental collaboration is slowly improving the internal parts of these journeys, although little improvement has been made on journey steps involving third parties.",4,"Customer journeys are used as a key co-ordinating concept across your whole organisation, and include steps/hand-offs to key partners. Progressive staff in all departments are aligning themselves to a customer-empathetic way of working, although a contingent of the organisation still remains internally focused.",5,Customer journeys are captured in sophisticated tooling and used as the key co-ordinating concept across your whole organisation and its eco-system. They are regularly updated as new segments or insights are identified. Key customer journey metrics are baked in score-cards organisation-wide. Potential problems are picked up and dealt-with pre-emptively.,6
27,40,Lifetime value,1,Your organisation gives very little kudos to customer loyalty and lifetime value. You focus over-whelmingly on short-term profit. No customers perceive you to be a strategic partner.,1,"Maximising profit from customers in the short terms remains your company's priority, even if leaders occasionally espouse a desire for long-term relationships. Whilst a few customer may have taken repeat business with you, this is typically due to status quo bias rather then any differentiating value on your behalf. There is no attempt to invest at risk in the short-term in order to build customer ",2,Your leadership are interested in beginning to balance short-term financial gain with longer-term loyalty. Some concessions are made on key contracts but this is an exception rather than the rule.,3,Your company has recognised mechanisms in place to balance short-term financial gain with mid-term customer loyalty. These are used with a number of key contracts/customers. These customers would describe you as a strategic partner.,4,"There is consistently a healthy debate across the organisation between short-term financial gain and mid-term customer loyalty. A number of loyalty-enhancing mechanism mechanisms are used consistently with customer including discounting, additional staff focus, service-adds. Pre-emptive service improvement initiatives are also regularly justified and funded on the grounds of lifetime value. You are",5,"Development of long-term customer relationships is the key focus of your organisation. Customer life-cycles are widely understood, as are appropriate value-adding activities and investment allowances per life-cycle stage. Quantified weigh-ups between mid/long-term value and short-term profit are a standard part of business. You are willing to risk a reasonable amount of money to build customer loya",6
27,41,"Product reliability, pricing, and convenience",1,Your products are notoriously unreliable and hard to use. Your approach to pricing is predominantly suck-it-and-see rather than based on logic.,1,"Your organisation is attempting to improve product quality through quality management and testing. There is little focus on user experience, however. Pricing is hap-hazard with a number of products perceived to be either excessively expensive and worryingly cheap.",2,"Your company has a reasonably robust product lifecycle management approach although it couldn't be described as agile or flexible. Product requirements, user experience, and pricing are loosely tested with some customers.",3,Your company has a strong product lifecycle management approach and incorporates some input from customers on requirements and user experience. Your products are typically reliable although you are not perceived to be the leader in terms of price or convenience.,4,"The whole company recognises the importance of differentiated products and services. You boast a sophisticated product lifecycle management approach, and your products are perceived to be reliable and reasonably easy to use. Your pricing is flexible and you can, based on logic, adjust it to be competitive as required.",5,"You consistently provide reliable products at competitive price, delivered with minimal difficulty. You lead the industry in terms of price and convenience.",6
27,41,Cost reduction and process optimisation,1,Little or no change has been made to your processes or ways of working recently.,1,"Changes to processes/cost bases in your organisation are only executed in a meaningful way  where a serious customer complaint or cost over-run demands it, rather than as a result of targeted analysis.",2,"Some high level analytical work has identified targeted areas for cost reduction and process optimisation in your organisation. Some easy-to-action responses have been delivered. There has been little consistency or continuity to this work however, and little engagement of the wider work-force on improvement ideas.",3,Detailed analytical work has identified areas for improvement and a culture of continuous improvement is taking hold in some departments. A moderate amount of CapEx investment is spent to take corrective action. Technology is an enabler and a number of systems/platforms have been utilised.,4,"Continuous, analytics-based improvement is in the culture of the organisation. A significant amount of CapEx is invested in improving your processes and cost-base, The indented benefit to your customers in terms of price-reduction and improvement in service is known.",5,"You are indefatigable in minimising overhead costs, eliminating intermediate production steps, reducing transaction and other 'friction' costs, and optimising processes across functional and organisational boundaries. Your customers regularly see improvements in price and service levels as a result.",6
27,41,Information excellence,1,"Your company utilises nothing but the most basic of business metrics to make decisions. This information resides across a multitude of systems, between which serious discrepancies can be found.",1,"Attempts are made to combine key business information into dashboards and repositories to inform decisions. Many of the dashboards are subjective and repositories used inconsistently, however. Data is often re-keyed multiple times, Excel spreadsheets abound, and information management behaviours are highly inconsistent.",2,Some APIs are used to connect disparate pools of data and there is some consistency in data management practices. Information is over-ridingly retrospective. Decision-making is as much a result of gut instinct as informed by potentially available data.,3,"A basic information management architecture is in place, with APIs/feeds between key systems and individuals. The architecture provides some advantage in terms of faster decision-making and continuous improvement. Predictive and primitive action remains a challenge.",4,"A sophisticated information management architecture is in place, reaching across both your organisation and key members of your eco-system. It is supported by strong and consistent information management behaviours across the organisation. AI and sophisticated algorithms help with predictive decisions and opportunities for operational and customer improvements.",5,"Information is the hear-blood of the organisation and its eco-system. You have an extremely sophisticated information management architecture and culture, and utilise it to provide competitive advantage e.g. around risk/exposure management. You are Incredibly efficient at decision-making and are often pre-emptive in your execution.",6
27,41,Automation and augmentation,1,Little technology is used to add value to your operations beyond the most basic ERP and CRM systems.,1,"Some plug-ins to existing ERP/CRM tools are adding a little value, but no strategy for AI/automation has been developed.",2,"A high level AI/automation strategy has been agreed. A few trials have been undertaken with AI, automation, and augmentation software and technology, and some successes had. Wide-scale roll-out is yet to happen, however.",3,"Off-the-shelf AI solutions are adding some value to your business, albeit at a level that is common with your competitors. Initiatives are also underway to automate low value activity but it is by no means wholesale.",4,"Differentiating AI solutions, tuned to your business, are adding value to key processes. Automation has recently removed the need for a significant amount of low value human activity. Augmenting technology is used by a  growing section of the work-force.",5,"Sophisticated AI is used to greatly enhance customer experience, optimise operations and provide competitive advantage. Autonomous and augmenting technology is used throughout operations.",6
27,41,Asset management,1,Your company has indicated little interest in the potential benefits of digital asset management.,1,"Some basic systems are used to track/manage physical assets. Your business occasionally undertakes ad-hoc initiatives aimed at asset optimisation. You have no plan or architecture for digital asset management, however.",2,"A few key leaders understand the benefits of digital asset management and have driven pilots around asset tracking, inventory optimisation and demand/supply optimisation. Few wide-spread benefits have been seen.",3,"High value assets and working materials are typically tracked and optimised in a digital manner. The easiest opportunities for optimising the balance sheet  have been executed e.g. better inventory and supply chain management, and utilisation of PAYG service. A high level digital asset management architecture has been developed.",4,Your company has a documented and well-understood approach to digital asset management. This incorporates physical and virtual assets. You provide granular tracking and management of most key assets and have undertaken significant optimisation of the balance sheet. You have proven your estate to be secure to all standard cyber attacks. Optimisation has predominantly benefited from improved predicti,5,Your company is perceived as world-class in terms of digital asset management. You have rolled out comprehensive IOT capabilities with automated feedback loops. Customers perceive your speed and responsiveness to be a differentiator. Your tooling manages physical and virtual assets in a predictive and pre-emptive manner. Your balance sheet is the envy of your competitors. You have proven your IT es,6
27,43,Differentiation,1,"Your products are perceived to be behind the curve, offering minimal differentiation. Customer churn is high and remaining customers are mainly with you due to status quo bias.",1,"Your leadership talks superficially to improvement in product offering, but successes are generally down to sales/service talent going the extra mile, legacy product continuing to provide the majority of profits, or your company benefitting from a preferential regulatory position.",2,"Your leadership is focussed on improving your portfolio of products but is struggling to embed an agile, customer-centric approach to doing so. Ideation remains reasonably ad-hoc although you do try to share ideas between teams. Development is typically slow and unpredictable. Your products are often very similar in nature to those of your competitors.",3,You have been making some progress in improving the quality of your portfolio. Your product development approach is gradually becoming more agile and you have been investing in dev-ops. Most ideas still come from within your company and prototyping/testing is somewhat limited. You can't charge a premium for your products but they are perceived to be solid.,4,"You are progressively releasing products at a faster rate and with greater customer success. Your product development approach is reasonably agile and tends to test ideas early in the lifecycle. You are increasingly engaging customers and partners as part of your ideation approach. Your products are perceived to be strong, albeit not generally market-leading.",5,You relentlessly offer customers leading-edge products and services that consistently enhance the customer's use of the product. You provide a continuous stream of state-of-the-art products and services. You look to render your own products obsolete by pursuing new solutions to problems your own latest product has just solved. Your brand and product quality justifies a premium.,6
27,43,Ideation,1,"New products generally come solely from the mind of a product manager, and often as a direct copy of others in the market. They are developed in a linear fashion. Minimal prototyping or testing is undertaken.",1,"Your leaderships talks superficially to increasing innovation and you may even be drawn into occasional cross-functional brain-storming sessions or feedback surveys. Day-to-day though, operations continue as usual, and your product team acts as something of a blackbox. There is no systematic method or tooling for capturing and evaluating ideas.",2,"Leadership have deliberately opened the product black-box is required them to engage with sales, marketing, design, and engineering. This has resulted in a plethora of ideas but there is no systematic method or tool for capturing and evaluating them. There is little ideation engagement of parties outside of the organisation.",3,"There is a quorate of individuals across the organisation who get the concepts of agile, collaborative working. They are bringing some structure to ideation, and typically also provide a link to customer and experts outside of the organisation. Whilst gaining some momentum, they tend to be the exception rather than the rule.",4,"Your company has a structured ideation method and tooling, including idea generation, evaluation, and testing. This includes input from multiple parties, including some external to the organisation. A few of your ideas are proving to be highly differentiated, although you believe you would benefit from a more diverse range of people inputting. You sometimes struggle to kill-off ideas that are not f",5,"You continuously recognise and embrace ideas originating outside your company as well as in it. This includes your customers as well as your eco-system. Involved parties (product, engineering, design etc) are engaged in a collaborative manner from the start, as a team of missionaries. You regularly use MVPs and hack days, and input significant amounts of analytical data and AI insights into ideatio",6
27,43,Development,1,"Your products take a long time to launch and follow a slow linear development process. Un-predicted issues tend to crop up throughout the development process, leading to launch delays and even product failure at a late stage. There is little consideration of opening up code to partners/customers or how it can re-used. There is little consideration of commercialisation. Plans are highly prescriptive",1,"Agile is a bit of a buzz-word and a small number of individuals would like to radically change your approach to development. Your development team, however, have been with the company for a long time and are wedded to their legacy systems and platforms. Their focus is predominantly on features, which they like to develop to high level of maturity before sharing. They do not encourage usability, val",2,"There is general recognition that your current approach to product development is too slow and unreliable to meet customer requirements. A number of ad-hoc initiatives have been kicked-off to try to improve the situation but there remains a lot of resistance. Governance around the product lifecycle has improved, with a number of products failed prior to launch, product teams partially incentivised ",3,"There is a quorate of individuals across the organisation who get the concepts of agile development. They are bringing some change to your development approach, establishing repositories of APIs and re-usable code, bringing in fresh dev-ops talent, and encouraging collaboration, iteration and testing. These ideas are fresh and not fully embedded but beginning to bear early fruit.",4,"You have a reasonably mature dev-ops team and approach and a sophisticated product lifecycle management tool. You typically seek to tackle product risks as early as possible through testing. You use prototyping, although often they are more functionally sophisticated than required.",5,"Your dev-ops team is highly talented and engineered for speed. You never tell a team member how to do things, but rather what to do. Risks are tackled up front and you focus on solving problems not implementing features. You all utilise a common method and sophisticated product lifecycle management tooling. You commercialise ideas quickly and fail fast.",6
27,43,Testing,1,"Testing is typically the last stage of your waterfall process and either leads to heavy delays, or test results being fudged in order for the product team to claim success and pass any hidden problems onto in-life teams. Only features and basic usability are generally tested, with no testing of value, demand or business viability.",1,"Whilst  your leadership likes the idea of testing products with customers, in practice this is little more than stage management. There is little quantitative or qualitative data from potential customers. Features remains the primary focus of testing, albeit these are tested a number of times during development. Some early usability feedback from design is incorporated into later iterations.",2,"Your leadership are encouraging the use of testing and prototyping during development, and some live testing and MVPs may be used. Basic attempts are made to understand demand and value. The approach and tools used for testing are often ad-hoc.",3,"There is a quorate of your leaders who are trying to build a standard, rigorous approach to testing. They are increasingly requiring early testing to tackle risks as early as possible. There remains some friction with traditional ways of working, but MVPs are becoming reasonable common and early product lifecycle gates require reasonable thought to have been put into understanding demand and value.",4,"Early, rigorous testing is recognised as a key requirement for your company. Significant time is taken to validate MVPs and prototypes and a number of products are killed for failing such tests. Customer and live data testing are common, although you rarely expose APIs too widely. You have invested in a common method and tool-set although some adherence is still lacking.",5,"Products are tested early and regularly during development. Risks are tackled as early as possible. Testing includes usability, value (quantitively, qualitatively), demand, feasibility, and business viability testing. Prototypes are widely used, including with live data. You expose APIs to allow customer and eco-system members to run tests for you. You have sophisticated testing and customer feedba",6
27,43,Customer education,1,There is limited join-up between your product and marketing teams. New products tend to be sold through standard channels. Messaging tends to focus on features rather than value drivers. Price-reductions are a common mechanism for building volume. There is very little customisation in messaging for difference customer segments.,1,Your marketing and sales teams tend to focus on pushing new products once they've launched rather than pre-emptively. Your product team conducts product training for them but it tends to take a few campaigns/sales before they actually get them. Your customers often remain confused as to the value of your new products.,2,"Strong sales/marketing individuals are able to have success with new products. This is as a result of their effort rather than a tight synching with the product team, however. They are often demanding materials from the product teams that are not provided as standard e.g. demos, sophisticated pricing mechanisms, minor customisation.",3,There is some alignment between product launch and marketing strategy. Products are sometimes pushed pre-launch although historic launch delay means this is done cautiously and with caveats. Some more innovative digital marketing techniques are used occasionally.,4,"There is decent strategic alignment between sales, marketing and product. Marketing regularly pushes products pre-launch and builds up some early customer demand. Sales/marketing collaterals tend to be reasonably sophisticated, with some digital marketing techniques, and reasonable segment targeting.",5,"Your marketing and sales teams are tightly in synch with product development and intimately understand the value new products provide, as proved by value testing. They proactively use innovative digital marketing techniques, customised to market segments, to build anticipation and brand awareness for new product launches.",6
